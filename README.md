# IndiePass
A social app for the IndieWeb.

Previously known as Indigenous, IndiePass is designed to be a cross platform Micropub/Microsub client that's simple to use on Android, iOS and desktop.

## Rebuilding in progress...

IndiePass is the next version of Indigenous, which has different apps for iOS, Android and Desktop. The goal of this rewrite is to bring all the different versions of the app together in one unified codebase, which will make it easier to maintain, and develop going forward.

As such, the state of this version is very much a work in progress, and you can find regular updates on my site, https://marksuth.dev

After a few false starts and dead-ends, I have now settled on this current approach for the codebase using Flutter, focusing first on getting the Android & iOS versions released.

## Documentation

I will shortly be launching documentation for the new app, with breakdowns of each post type, and a general how-to on using the app. As much as anything this is to act as a guide for myself of what needs to go where.

## Screenshot

Everything is still very much a work-in-progress, but here's a quick screenshot.
